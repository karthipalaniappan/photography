            <article>
              <p>What makes great <strong>product photography in Chennai</strong>? As a commercial photographer based in Tamil Nadu, 
                I believe it’s a blend of clean lighting, careful styling, and subtle editing — all designed to help products stand 
                out in today’s competitive digital space.</p>

          
              <p>In this post, I’ll take you behind the scenes of my shoot for Utinose Tablets, a health supplement. This shoot was 
                part of a product campaign for a healthcare brand in India, shot at my studio in Chennai.
                Here's how I created both the clean tabletop product shots and the more creative floating pill composition.</p>
          
              <h2>Lighting Setup for Product Photography</h2>
              <p>To give the packaging a crisp, even look, I used a 3-light setup:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Front light</strong> with a softbox to bring out the branding clearly</li>
                <li><strong>Side light</strong> with scrims for gentle shadows and subtle edge definition</li>
                <li><strong>Overhead light</strong> with an octabox on a C-stand to control top highlights</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The product was placed on a white tabletop background, and I strategically used black charts on the top, 
                front, and sides to block excess light and reduce unwanted reflections — even though the surface was matte. 
                This technique ensures even matte packaging doesn’t catch distracting light spills.</p>
          
              <h2>Post Production Workflow in Photoshop</h2>
              <p>After capturing the clean tabletop shot, I masked the product from the background using Photoshop, 
                added a soft contact shadow to anchor it visually</p>

              <p>And replaced the white background with a soft teal to make the overall image more appealing.</p>

              <h2>Creative Product Photography with Floating Pills</h2>
              <p>Since the product is a pill box, I took it a step further by adding visual storytelling using floating pills. Here's how I built the scene.</p>
          
              <p>I photographed the pills separately from different angles and resized them to create three layers of depth. Small pills were placed behind the product</p>
          
              <img src="assets/blog-2/medical-product-3.jpg" alt="Product photo shot by Chennai based photographer" class="blog-image horizontal">

              <p>Medium-sized pills were placed just in front of the product to create a sense of distance from the background.</p>

              <p>Finally, I added larger pills in the foreground to create dramatic depth and complete the layered look.</p>
          
              <h2>Final Result – Building Compelling Product photo</h2>
              <p>This project shows that even simple product packaging can be made dynamic with the right lighting, attention to materials, 
                and creative compositing. Small technical tweaks and post-production touches can turn ordinary shots into compelling visuals that truly sell.</p>
