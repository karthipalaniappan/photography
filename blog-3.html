        <h2>Jewellery Photography Setup: Materials & Mood</h2>

        <p>Jewellery photography demands more than just a good camera — it requires careful
          attention to details, styling, lighting, storytelling, and the right gear. As a commercial product
          photographer
          based in Tamil Nadu, I focus on creating visuals that highlight a piece’s elegance and detail. For this
          project,
          I explored multiple setups for gold bracelets and earrings to bring out their design and character, using a
          Nikon D850
          paired with a 105mm f/2.8 macro lens to capture intricate textures and fine craftsmanship with clarity.</p>


        <h2>Bracelet Styling for Premium Product Shoots</h2>
        <p>For the bracelet, I chose a maroon velvet cloth as the background to give a soft, silky feel.
          I placed the bracelet on a maroon-colored pillow bangle cushion to match the theme. The dark setting
          was intentional — it helps to draw attention to the jewellery itself, without distracting elements around it.
        </p>

        <h2>Earstud Composition with Velvet baground & textered wooden box</h2>
        <p>For the Earstuds, I used the same maroon velvet cloth as the background but placed a pair of colorful
          Earstuds on a brown jewellery box. The textured background combined with rich tones helps stone colors
          pop beautifully. This setup was styled to give a regal, moody look while still keeping the focus on the
          jewellery.</p>

        <p>Shot at a boutique in Chennai, this jewellery product catalogue project highlights how thoughtful surfaces
          like velvet and a soft
          lighting setup can create a premium, moody look while emphasizing colour, texture, and craftsmanship. The
          controlled lighting helped
          maintain highlights on the stones and edges of the jewellery, ensuring an elegant feel with minimal
          distractions — allowing each piece
          to truly shine through the frame.</p>
