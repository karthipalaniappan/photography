                <h2>Jewellery Photography Setup: Materials & Mood</h2>

                  <p>Jewellery photography demands more than just a good camera — it requires careful 
                    attention to details, styling, lighting, storytelling, and the right gear. As a commercial product photographer 
                    based in Tamil Nadu, I focus on creating visuals that highlight a piece’s elegance and detail. For this project, 
                    I explored multiple setups for gold bracelets and earrings to bring out their design and character, using a Nikon D850 
                    paired with a 105mm f/2.8 macro lens to capture intricate textures and fine craftsmanship with clarity.</p>

            
                  <h2>Bracelet Styling for Premium Product Shoots</h2>
                <p>For the bracelet, I chose a maroon velvet cloth as the background to give a soft, silky feel. 
                  I placed the bracelet on a maroon-colored pillow bangle cushion to match the theme. The dark setting 
                  was intentional — it helps to draw attention to the jewellery itself, without distracting elements around it.</p>

                <h2>Earstud Composition with Velvet baground & textered wooden box</h2>
                <p>For the Earstuds, I used the same maroon velvet cloth as the background but placed a pair of colorful 
                  Earstuds on a brown jewellery box. The textured background combined with rich tones helps stone colors 
                  pop beautifully. This setup was styled to give a regal, moody look while still keeping the focus on the jewellery.</p>

                <p>Shot at a boutique in Chennai, this jewellery product catalogue project highlights how thoughtful surfaces like velvet and a soft 
                  lighting setup can create a premium, moody look while emphasizing colour, texture, and craftsmanship. The controlled lighting helped 
                  maintain highlights on the stones and edges of the jewellery, ensuring an elegant feel with minimal distractions — allowing each piece 
                  to truly shine through the frame.</p>
